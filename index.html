    <p>Heyy! My name is Cherie, I am a 24 year old girl born and bred in the East of London; though my background is Nigerian.</p>

    <p>I've always had an interest in computers-which I got from my dad- but went to university and studied a course to do with children and young people (Class of 2020 <span style='font-size:20px;'>&#127881;</span>).
    <br> After a a couple of years of working in schools, I've decided that I don't want to be stuck in a classroom and I want a job role that comes with more flexibity 
    and I want to tap into my creative side which I know I have.</p>

    <p>In my spare time which I have a lot of at the moment lol, I like to go out with my friends and have a good time, but I do also cherish my bed and some me time.</p>
